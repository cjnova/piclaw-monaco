# User Stories — Primary User Profile

## Persona: Power User (Rui)

- **Devices:** iPhone (away/quick), iPad (primary daily driver), Desktop (deep work)
- **Sessions:** 5-6 active across multiple instances, topic-based, long-lived
- **Switching:** Typeahead on keyboard, swipe on touch
- **Compose style:** Short concise instructions, occasional long paste (bug reports, feature specs)
- **Queue usage:** Very heavy — queues follow-ups constantly, pulls back for editing frequently
- **Abort:** Rare, expects partial summary
- **Slash commands:** Rare; `/tint` and `/theme` are the most frequent
- **Editor:** Critical on writing-focused instance; zen mode, markdown preview, popouts all used
- **Workspace:** Uploads occasional but critical; rename/delete important but clunky
- **Settings:** Opened very often during dev/test; accessed via typeahead primarily
- **Attachments:** Screenshots pasted constantly, lightbox and file preview heavily used
- **Panes:** Terminal, VNC, office viewers all used on all devices
- **Adaptive Cards:** Liked for logins/pickers; widgets for complex input
- **Push notifications:** Not a priority (HTTPS-limited)
- **Recovery action:** Refresh (full page reload)

- Tab activation: on mouse-down, not mouse-up
- Zen mode: no CPU spikes on hover
- Preview splitter: stable during resize
